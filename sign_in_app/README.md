# Sign In App

The app is built using Flutter and I have used Firebase to create accounts and store information related to anyone who signs into the app. I have implemented two API's. Google and Facebook. The app is capable of signing you into the app using either Google account or Facebook account. Once signed in, you display image, name and email associated with the respective account will be displayed.
